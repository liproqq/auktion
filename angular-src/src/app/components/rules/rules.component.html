<h2 id="FA">Free Agency</h2>
<p>Free Agents will be auctioned off, meaning every team has the chance to acquire a free agent. As in an auction, the highest bidder wins. However, to win the auction, your bid must stand the highest for at least 24 hours. The minimum contract length is
  1 year. The maximum is 4 years, 5 years with bird rights. We will use this table for determining the trumping of bids:</p>

<p>The numbers in the table are the standard multipliers. The rows represent the number of years in your proposed contract, and the columns represent the number of years of the previous proposed contract, or contract. Minimum bid for a player is $1M. There
  is no maximum bid other than your remaining cap space.</p>
<p>To top a bid with the same number of years the bid must increase by $1. Only multiples of $1 are eligble as bids. Bids will be rounded down to the next $1</p>
<p>Only the incumbent team can offer a five year contract to the player. During regular season players can only sign contracts until the end of the season.</p>
<h2>Roster</h2>
<p>You can only have up to 15 players on your roster ingame. If you have less than 13 players on your roster it will be filled up by a low overall player.</p>
<p>You have a salary cap of $1000 each season. You can never go over it. If you abuse a bug to get over the cap without reporting it you might be excluded from the league.</p>
<p>You can only sign players who are available in the standard roster of the current NBA2K.</p>
<p>New general managers can void one contract during the offseason in order to fix their team.</p>
<h2>Trades</h2>
<p>Trades are allowed throughout the season until the start of the playoffs. Trades must be posted in the appropriate discord channel and have to be approved by the trade board before taking effect. The trade board will evaluate each contract in the trade on a scale from -50 to +50. The evaluations of each member will be averaged across all voting trading-board members. If the average absolute difference of the entire trade is within 10 points, the trade will be approved.</p>
<p>If there are larger differences in asset values, the trade board will consider specific team circumstances (roster need and cap-sheet). These reasons need to be specified by the trade parties before submission. The trade board can only consider reasons provided by the trade parties.</p>
<p>Trades with an asset value difference that exceeds 25 points will be rejected and the asset evaluation will be published and specific instructions on how the trade could be restructured will be provided based on the trade boardâ€™s asset evaluation.</p>
<h2>Waiving contracts</h2>
<p>Players can be waived throughout the regular season and off-season. The waiving team will have to pay a penalty for one season depending on the previous contract of the player. The waived player will be a free agent. The waive will be announced 24h before the player hits free agency. If the waived player is signed by another team the penalty stays in place. The waiving team can not sign or acquire via trade the waived player in the same season</p>
<p>The waiving team will have to pay a percentage of the yearly salary, depending on contract length, as given below. The penalty will be rounded to the next highest integer.</p>
